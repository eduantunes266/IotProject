## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Firmware/IoT:** C++ (Arduino)  
- **Server/Processing:** Raspberry Pi (Linux)

---

## 📦 Materials Used

- 🧠 **Raspberry Pi** (local server + camera)  
- 🔌 **Arduino MKR1000 WiFi** (sensors and communication with the server)  
- 📷 Camera module (connected to the Raspberry Pi)  
- 🌐 Local WiFi network for communication between devices

---

## 🌐 Website Features

1. **📊 Dashboard**  
   Displays real-time data sent by the Arduino (e.g., temperature, humidity sensors, etc.)

2. **📁 History**  
   Stores and presents recorded data over time.

3. **📸 Camera Page**  
   Shows image streaming or snapshots captured by the Raspberry Pi.
